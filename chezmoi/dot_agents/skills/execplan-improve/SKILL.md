description: >-
  Reads an existing ExecPlan, deeply analyzes every referenced file and code path in the codebase, then rewrites the plan with concrete, code-grounded improvements.
  Use when user asks to improve an execplan, review a plan, make a plan better, audit an execplan, refine a plan, strengthen a plan, or says "improve the plan."

# Improve ExecPlan

> **Core philosophy:** Every improvement must trace back to something found in the actual code. No speculative additions. No surface-level rewording.

## Ousterhout lens

Use John Ousterhout's design philosophy as the design-quality lens for the audit:

- prefer deep modules over shallow wrappers
- prefer interfaces that hide sequencing and policy details
- prefer fewer concepts, fewer knobs, and fewer special cases
- prefer simpler mental models over visually tidy decomposition
- prefer moving complexity behind a stable boundary over redistributing it

Treat these as the main forms of complexity:

- change amplification
- cognitive load
- unknown unknowns

An improved plan is not just more accurate. It should also be clearer about why the target design is simpler and what complexity the change removes from the rest of the system.

## Resolving the Base Repo

You may be running from a Codex worktree (e.g. `~/.codex/worktrees/<id>/<repo>/`). Worktrees are shallow copies — the main repo often has files the worktree does not. Always resolve the base repo path:

1. Check if the current working directory contains `/.codex/worktrees/` in its path.
2. If yes, extract the repo name (the last path component, e.g. `tail-bot`) and set the base repo to `~/<repo-name>`.
3. If no, the base repo is the current working directory.

When looking for `{baseDir}/.agents/plans` contents (ExecPlans, potential-bugs, PLANS.md), check **both** the worktree `.agents/` and the base repo `.agents/`. Prefer the worktree copy if both exist; fall back to the base repo copy.

## Inputs

Default ExecPlan location: `.agents/plans`. There maybe multiple plans for different features in there, only read and use what we interested in. 

Use a different path if the user provides one. If no ExecPlan exists in either location, tell the user and stop.

## Understand the purpose of execplans by reading PLANS.md

Read `.agents/dd-mm-yy-title-describing-the-feature-PLANS.md` from the base repo (or worktree if present) before modifying the ExecPlan.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Short-Circuit Low-Value Repeats

Before doing any repo work, inspect only the immediately previous assistant turn in the current conversation.

- If that immediately previous assistant turn was an `execplan-improve` result whose entire content was exactly `skip`, return exactly `skip`.
- If that immediately previous assistant turn was an `execplan-improve` result that ended with `Usefulness score: N/10 - ...` and `N <= 3`, return exactly `skip`.
- In either skip case, do not read PLANS.md, do not inspect adjacent code, and do not rewrite the plan.
- If the immediately previous assistant turn was not clearly an `execplan-improve` result, continue normally.
- Do not scan further back in the conversation for older `execplan-improve` results.
- Only continue into the improvement workflow when there is no immediately previous `execplan-improve` result, or that immediate prior usefulness score is `4/10` or higher.

### Step 1: Parse the ExecPlan

Read the entire ExecPlan. Extract every file path, function/class/module name, command, milestone, acceptance criterion, and assumption.

### Step 2: Deep-Read Referenced Files

Read each file the plan mentions. Locate each named function/class/module. Flag anything that doesn't match reality:

- Missing or renamed files
- Different function signatures, types, or return values
- Import chains the plan doesn't account for
- Test files and test patterns actually in use
- Build/run commands the project actually uses

### Step 3: Explore Adjacent Code

Read files that import from or are imported by the referenced files. Look for:

- Existing patterns the plan should follow but doesn't mention
- Utilities the plan reinvents instead of reusing
- Conventions (naming, file structure, test layout) the plan would violate
- Related tests that would break or need updating
- Edge cases the plan misses
- Leaked sequencing or policy that the plan should hide behind a better boundary
- Shallow abstractions or pass-through layers the plan currently preserves without justification
- Duplicate concepts or special-case branches the plan could collapse or absorb

### Step 4: Audit the Plan

Evaluate against seven criteria:

| Criteria | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | Do paths exist? Do signatures match? Are behaviors described correctly? |
| **Completeness** | Every file, test, import, and dependency covered? Any missing milestones? |
| **Self-containment** | Could a novice implement end-to-end with only this file? Terms defined? Commands complete? |
| **Feasibility** | Steps achievable in order? Hidden dependencies between milestones? |
| **Testability** | Concrete verification per milestone? Test paths, names, assertions specified? |
| **Safety** | Idempotent? Retriable? Destructive ops have rollback? |
| **Design Quality** | Does the plan actually reduce complexity, deepen a boundary, hide sequencing/policy, and explain the complexity dividend? |

### Step 5: Rewrite the Plan

Rewrite in-place at the same file path. Preserve existing `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` content.

Apply only code-grounded improvements:

- Fix inaccuracies (wrong paths, signatures, line numbers)
- Add missing files, functions, dependencies, and milestones
- Split milestones that are too large
- Fill in vague commands with working directories and expected output
- Make acceptance criteria observable and verifiable
- Define undefined jargon
- Add idempotence/recovery instructions where missing
- Specify test-first verification where feasible
- Reference actual patterns and utilities discovered in Step 3
- Ensure every PLANS.md-required section exists and is substantive
- Make the plan explicit about the simpler boundary it is aiming to create
- Call out when a proposed abstraction is shallow and either justify it or replace it with a simpler plan shape
- Remove plan language that adds concepts or layers without reducing interface burden
- Name the complexity dividend: what future readers or callers no longer need to know after the change

Do not change the plan's intent. Do not add milestones that don't serve the original purpose. Make the same plan more accurate, complete, and executable.

If your review finds no substantive code-grounded improvements, do not churn the prose just to make a diff. Leave the body of the plan alone aside from the required bottom-of-file revision note.

### Step 6: Score the Usefulness of This Pass

Score the usefulness of this invocation, not the absolute quality of the final plan.

Use this rubric:

- `9-10/10`: the pass fixed multiple concrete execution blockers or major missing dependencies, and the implementation path would likely have failed without these changes.
- `7-8/10`: the pass added several substantive, code-grounded corrections that materially improve executability.
- `4-6/10`: the pass made real but moderate improvements; the plan is clearer and safer, but not fundamentally different.
- `1-3/10`: the pass found little to improve beyond minor wording, sequencing, or already-obvious clarifications.

The justification must be specific about what changed or what was missing. A low score is the correct outcome when the plan was already strong or the pass could not find meaningful new gaps.

### Step 7: Summarize Changes

Append a revision note at the bottom of the plan describing what changed and why. Do not record the usefulness score inside the plan.

Report to the user:

- **Fixed**: inaccuracies corrected (wrong paths, signatures, etc.)
- **Added**: missing coverage (files, tests, milestones, commands)
- **Strengthened**: vague sections made concrete (acceptance criteria, verification steps)
- **Flagged**: risks or concerns worth attention
- Final line: `Usefulness score: X/10 - <specific reason>` when a pass ran

If Step 0 short-circuits, return exactly `skip` and nothing else.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Surface-level rewording** — Changing prose without reading code is worthless.
- **Adding boilerplate** — Every addition must be specific to this codebase and this change.
- **Removing intent** — Improve execution detail; do not second-guess the goal.
- **Speculative additions** — Every addition must trace back to something discovered in the code.
- **Ignoring existing progress** — Preserve completed milestones. Do not uncheck work that was done.
- **Blessing shallow design** — Do not preserve a needlessly thin abstraction or leaky interface just because it was already in the draft.
