- Do not git commit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer to have self-documented code over comments.
- When needing to check github code, always clone it using `ghq get` instead of using the web 
- In all interactions, plans, and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
