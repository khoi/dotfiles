## General best practices

## Do

- Be thorough, read more code before making decision, if unsure, read even more code.
- use `gh` cli tool to interact with Github
- when stuck, ask clarifying questions, propose a plan
- Prefer to use `ast-grep` to search for code

## Don't

- do not add new dependencies without approval

### Literate Programming

Apply literate programming principles to make code self-documenting and maintainable across all languages:

#### Core Principles

1. **Explain the Why, Not Just the What**: Focus on business logic, design decisions, and reasoning rather than describing what the code obviously does.

2. **Top-Down Narrative Flow**: Structure code to read like a story with clear sections that build logically:

   ```rust
   // ==============================================================================
   // Plugin Configuration Extraction
   // ==============================================================================

   // First, we extract plugin metadata from Cargo.toml to determine
   // what files we need to build and where to put them.
   ```

3. **Inline Context**: Place explanatory comments immediately before relevant code blocks, explaining the purpose and any important considerations:

   ```python
   # Convert timestamps to UTC for consistent comparison across time zones.
   # This prevents edge cases where local time changes affect rebuild detection.
   utc_timestamp = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(file_stat.st_mtime)
   ```

4. **Avoid Over-Abstraction**: Prefer clear, well-documented inline code over excessive function decomposition when logic is sequential and context-dependent. Functions should serve genuine reusability, not just file organization.

5. **Self-Contained When Practical**: Reduce dependencies on external shared utilities when the logic is straightforward enough to inline with good documentation.

#### Implementation Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Future developers can quickly understand both implementation and design rationale
- **Debugging**: When code fails, documentation helps identify which logical step failed and why
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Code serves as documentation of the problem domain, not just the solution
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Readers don't need to mentally reconstruct the author's reasoning

#### When to Apply

Use literate programming for:

- Complex algorithms with multiple phases or decision points
- Code implementing business logic rather than simple plumbing
- Code where the "why" is not immediately obvious from the "what"
- Integration points between systems where context matters

Avoid over-documenting:

- Simple utility functions where intent is clear from the signature
- Trivial getters/setters or obvious wrapper code
- Code that's primarily syntactic sugar over well-known patterns
