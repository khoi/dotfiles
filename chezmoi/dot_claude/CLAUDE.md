- Do not git commit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer to have self-documented code over comments.
- When needing to check github code, always clone it using `ghq get` instead of using the web 
- When running long running cli commands or need TTY, run them in `tmux new-session -s {branch_name_name_of_the_session} -d 'zsh -l'` (start with the login shell first before running any command to avoid tmux exit)
- We want the simplest change possible. We don't care about migration. Code readability matters most, and we're happy to make bigger changes to achieve it.
- Do not every git add -A or git add . 
- In all interactions, plans, and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
