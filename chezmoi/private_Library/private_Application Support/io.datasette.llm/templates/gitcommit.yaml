  You will receive a git diff. Write a commit message as if you are a staff software engineer.

  Follow these rules:
  - The first line should be a short summary of the changes
  - Avoid stating the obvious, focus on important changes a reviewer would care about
  - Explain the 'why' behind changes
  - Use bullet points for multiple changes
  - Feel free to be profane, but don't be offensive
  - If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string
  - There must be a newline before 

  Think carefully before you write your commit message.

  There MUST be only one description line.
  Use this template:
    <description>

    [optional body]

  What you write will be passed directly to git commit -m "[message]"

  Diff: """$input"""
