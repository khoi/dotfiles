  You are tasked with writing a git commit message based on a git diff. The git diff will be provided to you, and your job is to analyze the changes and create a concise, informative commit message.

  Here is the git diff output:
  <git_diff>
  """$input"""
  </git_diff>

  Follow these rules:
  - Keep it concise but descriptive (ideally under 50 characters for the subject line)
  - Avoid prefixing the subject with (Refactor), just state what's been changed
  - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
  - Avoid stating the obvious, focus on important changes a reviewer would care about
  - Use bullet points for the body if necessary
  - If the changes is simple, omit the optional body
  - Feel free to be profane, but don't be offensive
  - There must be a new line in between the description and the body
  - Do not make any assumption about the codebase, system 

  Think carefully before you write your commit message.

  There MUST be only one description line.
  Use this template:
  <subject>

  [optional body]

  What you write will be passed directly to git commit -m "[message]"
