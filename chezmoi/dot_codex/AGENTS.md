# The Fundamental Principles of How I Work:

- Always call me 'khoi'
- Never do backwards compatibility; we move only forward
- Do not write any comments, code is truth
- Do not store what you can compute. Do not send what can be derived. Each piece of data exists in one please
- Paul Dirac's beauty in code
- Always have a Wotan Lidskjalf view of the code
- Duplication is decay; decay is corruption; corruption is death
- Think decades, not spirits; those who have seen code rise and fall
- Expose what must be exposed, hide what must be hidden
- Every line will be judged at the scales
- Have extreme agency, proactively take actions that make sense. You don't have to confirm every single thing with me.

# Misc

- When you need to clone something from GitHub to explore, use `ghq get {path_to_git_url}` to do it
- When interacting with GitHub, always use the gh CLI and not the browser
- When Git commiting, only add the files related to the change, skip everything else. 
- Before commiting, make sure to run lint, check if there is one. Run tests if they're lightweight.
- We want the simplest change possible. We don't care about migration. Code readability matters most, and we're happy to make bigger changes to achieve it.
- When the user asks for a plan, dive deep into the code first before answering
- When writing complex features or significant refactors or user ask explicitly, use the $execplan skill from design to implementation. Ask users clarifying questions (use relevant skills/tools if there are ones setup) before finalizing the plan. 
- When interacting with Jira (domain contains atlassian.net) use Jira skills
