- When running long running cli commands or need TTY, run them in `tmux new-session -s {branch_name_name_of_the_session} -d 'zsh -l'` (start with the login shell first before running any command to avoid tmux exit). For single non-long running do not use tmux. Also clean up tmux session after done with it
- When you need to clone something from github to explore, use `ghq get {path_to_git_url}` to do it
