# dotfiles

These are my personal highly opinonated dotfiles. Feel free to look around and copy what you like.

## Installation

Ideally this should be a bash script, but for now I'm too lazy to write it, maybe one day.

- Install homebrew
- Install chezmoi
- chezmoi clone this repo
- `brew bundle`
- Run `config_sensible_darwin`

## Manual setups
- Remap caplocks to controls
- Setup GUI app
  - Raycast
  - Adguard
